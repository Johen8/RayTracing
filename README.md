To define your scene, use the scene file. Remember to correctly set the path to save the images and verify if it is valid! 
Please follow the instructions in the scene file, because as of now the program is not robust enough to handle formatting errors.
If you want at any point to have zero objects of any kind, leave the properties line for that object blank.

Colors range from 0 to 1.
Special color value ranges from 0 to 1 for reflection and 2 for a checkered pattern.
